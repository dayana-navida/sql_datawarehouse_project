# 🏗️ SQL Data Warehouse Project

## 📌 Project Overview
This project demonstrates how to build a Data Warehouse using SQL and perform basic analytics on the data.

The main goal of this project is to:

Understand how raw data is converted into useful business data

Practice data warehousing concepts using SQL

Learn how analytics-ready tables are created for reporting

This project is created as a learning and portfolio project.

## 🧱 Data Warehouse Architecture

This project follows the **Medallion Architecture**:

### 🔹 Bronze Layer

* Stores raw data as received from source CSV files
* No transformations applied

### 🔹 Silver Layer

* Cleans and standardizes the raw data
* Handles missing values and formatting issues

### 🔹 Gold Layer

* Contains business-ready **fact and dimension tables**
* Designed using **star schema**
* Used for analytics, reports, and KPIs
